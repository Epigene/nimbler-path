This gem replaces most-used Pathname class ruby methods with much faster counterparts written in Nim.  
Use for hassle-free, dependency-free speed gains, primarily in Rails projects.  

## Supported Platforms
As of version 0.9.0 the gem supports 64bit versions of Linux and Mac.  
Support for Windows is a hassle due to differing path separator, among other things.  
Open an issue or PR if other OS support is needed.  

## Dependencies

```ruby
ruby ">= 2.1.0" # for required keyword arguments
```

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'nimbler_path', require: false
```

```ruby
# in an initializer like /config/initializers/nimbler_path.rb
require 'nimbler_path'
require 'nimbler_path/monkeypatch'

NimblerPath.apply_monkeypatch!
```

## Discussion

[faster_path](https://github.com/danielpclark/faster_path) identifies these Pathname methods as taking the most execution time.

```rb
Pathname#chop_basename(path) @ https://goo.gl/9Lk1N9 called 24456 times, 25% of execution time alone
Pathname#to_s (implicit C definition?) called 29172 times.
Pathname#<=> (implicit C definition?) called 24963 times.
Pathname#initialize in C @ https://goo.gl/dqB8R2 called 23103 times.
Pathname#absolute? @ https://goo.gl/5aXYxw called 4840 times.
Pathname#+ @ https://goo.gl/W7biJu called 4606 times.
Pathname#plus @ https://goo.gl/eRxLYt called 4606 times.
Pathname#join @ https://goo.gl/9NzWRt called 4600 times.
Pathname#extname in C @ https://goo.gl/uANaNu called 4291 times.
Pathname#hash in C @ https://goo.gl/6eVS1x called 4207 times.
Pathname#to_path in C @ https://goo.gl/EX7Cfx called 2706 times.
Pathname#directory? in C @ https://goo.gl/PbMbjY called 2396 times.
Pathname#entries in C @ https://goo.gl/8ALU6R called 966 times.
```

Ignoring methods already implemented in C leaves us with:

```rb
Pathname#chop_basename(path) @ https://goo.gl/9Lk1N9 called 24456 times, 25% of execution time alone

Pathname#+ @ https://goo.gl/W7biJu called 4606 times.
Pathname#plus @ https://goo.gl/eRxLYt called 4606 times.
Pathname#join @ https://goo.gl/9NzWRt called 4600 times.
Pathname#absolute? @ https://goo.gl/5aXYxw called 4840 times.
# flipside
Pathname#relative? @ https://goo.gl/QK4PCs
```

This project, at most, aims to provide performant variants for those six methods.
